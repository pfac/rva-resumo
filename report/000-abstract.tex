\begin{abstract}
This document analyzes and discusses the work documented in \cite{bleiweiss08}, where the author innovates by performing a GPU implementation of a highly irregular search algorithm to be used for pathfinding in artificially inteligent agents.

While speedups were obtained, the environmental setup and methodologies are questioned by other authors. Also, little effort was made to improve the performance of the algorithm, while much of the content in the paper is spent defining concepts which, despite being useful, are of the general knowledge of the target audience.
