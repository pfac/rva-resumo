\section{Results}

The implemented library was tested using several undirected roadmaps (with $N$ nodes), each using $N^2$ agents.

The benchmarks were performed using two distinct CPU versions (a C++ scalar optimized with O2 version, and a manually tuned SIMD version) and the GPU version already described. CPU tests were performed using a single core processor and a dual processor single core machine. Also, the library was tested using both the A$\star$ algorithm and the \textit{Dijkstra} algorithm (no heuristic).

The GPU version achieved a speedup of 27 agains the CPU scalar C++ optimized version (\textit{Dijkstra} algorithm). Using the A$\star$ algorithm with an Euclidean distance heuristic, it achieved a speedup of around 55, due to the presence of more arithmetic computations per node. The dual processor SSE implementation obtained a speedup of 2.3 against the same version. Compared to the SIMD version, the CUDA implementation using the A$\star$ algorithm reached a speedup of 24.
