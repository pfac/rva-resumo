	\frametitle{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GPU implementation of the A$\star$ surpassed the CPU implementation;
		\vfill
		\item Outdated:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The innovation is a GPU implementation of A$\star$ (naive);
			\item CUDA (1.1) was a rather ``new'' approach to parallelism;
			\item GPU memory was limited to 512 MB;
		\end{itemize}
		\vfill
		\item Methodology is not the most correct:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Anja Johansson suggested less agents and more nodes;
			\item Strange CPU choice;
			\item Strange mix of versions;
			\item No highly parallel shared memory implementation;
			\item No distributed memory implementation;
		\end{itemize}
